  "summary": "Diff adds a React canvas-based 2D shooter with start/pause/game-over screens, HUD, React Query-powered leaderboard UI, and Motoko leaderboard APIs. However, backend persistence via stable storage is not implemented, and leaderboard display lacks the requested username/profile-name fallback behavior. Generated image asset files under public/ are not evidenced in the diff summary. There is also unrequested footer/branding content and emoji usage.",

      "requirement": "Use stable storage so leaderboard scores persist across canister upgrades (stable variables).",
      "reason": "backend/main.mo defines `let scores = Map.empty<Principal, Nat>();` which is not a stable variable and no preupgrade/postupgrade or stable structure is shown, so persistence across upgrades is not evidenced.",

      "reason": "Frontend code references the expected paths, but the diff summary does not show the actual image files being added under `frontend/public/assets/generated` (binary/static assets may be omitted, but no evidence is provided here).",
